# üîí Flask File Exposure Security Testing Report

## Executive Summary
Security testing completed on the Flask file upload and access application. **Multiple vulnerabilities identified** that could lead to sensitive data exposure and unauthorized file access.

---

## üö® Critical Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. **CRITICAL: Sensitive File Exposure** 
- **Status**: ‚ùå **VULNERABLE**
- **Test**: Direct access to uploaded protected files
- **Finding**: `protected_file.txt` is **directly accessible** via `/files/protected_file.txt`
- **Impact**: Sensitive content exposed: "*This document contains sensitive data! Keep it secret!!*"
- **Risk Level**: **HIGH**

### 2. **CRITICAL: Malicious File Upload** 
- **Status**: ‚ùå **VULNERABLE**
- **Test**: File upload validation
- **Finding**: Application accepts **ANY file type** including potentially malicious files
- **Evidence**: Successfully uploaded `malicious.php` file
- **Impact**: Could lead to code execution, malware distribution
- **Risk Level**: **HIGH**

---

## ‚úÖ Security Controls Working

### 1. **Path Traversal Protection**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **SECURE**
- **Test**: Attempted access to `../../app.py`
- **Result**: Access properly blocked (404 error)
- **Finding**: Application correctly prevents directory traversal attacks

### 2. **System File Protection**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **SECURE** 
- **Test**: Attempted access to system files (`../app.py`, `../../etc/passwd`)
- **Result**: Access properly blocked for system files outside upload directory

## üìä Test Results Summary

| Test Case | Status | Risk Level | Details |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------|
| Path Traversal | ‚úÖ PASS | Low | Directory traversal blocked |
| Direct File Access | ‚ùå FAIL | **HIGH** | Uploaded files exposed |
| File Upload Validation | ‚ùå FAIL | **HIGH** | No file type restrictions |
| System File Access | ‚úÖ PASS | Low | System files protected |

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Implement File Access Control**
   ```python
   # Add authentication/authorization checks
   @app.route('/files/<filename>')
   @require_auth  # Add authentication decorator
   def files(filename):
       # Add user permission checks
   ```

2. **Add File Upload Validation**
   ```python
   ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}
   
   def allowed_file(filename):
       return '.' in filename and \
              filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS
   ```

3. **Implement File Access Restrictions**
   ```python
   # Check if user has permission to access specific files
   # Add file ownership/permission system
   ```

### Additional Security Measures:

- Add file size limits
- Implement virus scanning for uploads
- Add rate limiting for file operations
- Use secure file storage (outside web root)
- Add audit logging for file access

## üéØ Compliance Impact

Based on project brief requirements:

- ‚úÖ **Path Traversal Testing**: Successfully identified protection mechanisms
- ‚ùå **Direct File Access**: Failed - sensitive files accessible
- ‚ùå **File Upload Validations**: Failed - no validation implemented
- ‚ùå **Access Control**: Failed - no authorization checks

**Overall Security Grade: D (Major vulnerabilities present)**

## üìà Files Currently Exposed

The following sensitive files are currently accessible via direct URL:

1. `protected_file.txt` - Contains sensitive data
2. `confidencial_012.txt` - User uploaded file  
3. Any uploaded file in `/uploaded_files/` directory

**Recommendation**: Implement immediate access controls to protect sensitive data.
